            Hi! I'm a full-stack software engineer who's passionate about the integration of tech, art, and accessibility. In addition to the technical knowledge I've gained through years on the job, I have a background in art and design that supplements my skills in front-end development, while my experiences in education translate seamlessly into clear and constructive communication skills with clients and co-workers. I have worked on a number of successful web applications and have mentored dozens of budding software engineers. Iâ€™m dedicated and super adaptable, and am proud to say that I have fulfilled if not exceeded expectations in every role I've ever worked.
